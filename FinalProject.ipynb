    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of higher education data spanning from 2001 to 2022. It aims to uncover how demographic attributes such as gender, race, and immigration status influence degree selection and completion rates across different academic disciplines and award levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this project include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analyzing Trends**: Identify how different demographic groups select degrees and the influence of demographic attributes on these decisions.\n",
    "- **Comparing Completion Rates**: Evaluate how demographic factors impact the rates of degree completion, identifying disparities and factors contributing to success or challenges in higher education.\n",
    "- **Providing Insights**: Deliver actionable insights to educational institutions to enhance academic offerings and support services for a diverse student body.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical Question\n",
    "\n",
    "How do demographic attributes such as gender, race, and immigration status influence degree selection and completion rates across different academic disciplines and award levels in higher education institutions from 2000 to 2022?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this analysis was sourced from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), available through the National Center for Education Statistics. You can access the dataset from the following [link](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx?year=2000&surveyNumber=3&sid=c610fb17-7be5-4a97-8c02-99076b161130&rtid=7).\n",

    "##  System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Data Ingestion**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "The Data Ingestion stage involved the automated aggregation of datasets from the years 2001 to 2022, streamlining the process to form a unified data framework. This phase was crucial for preparing the datasets for comprehensive analysis, ensuring that data from various years could be analyzed collectively to identify trends and patterns over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Acquisition\n",
    "Data was acquired by scraping annual datasets available from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), hosted by the National Center for Education Statistics. Each dataset corresponded to a specific year and contained various metrics related to higher education institutions, such as enrollment numbers, graduation rates, and demographic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Combination\n",
    "The data from each year was aggregated into a single dataset. This involved reading individual datasets from yearly files, each containing data structured in a consistent format across years. These individual datasets were then concatenated into a single DataFrame, ensuring that each record was appropriately aligned and structured for subsequent phases of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outcome\n",
    "The combined dataset resulted in a comprehensive DataFrame containing 5,797,529 records and 197 columns. This aggregation facilitates a more seamless analysis, allowing for cross-year comparisons and trend analysis across multiple dimensions of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final aggregated data was stored in a Parquet file, chosen for its efficiency in handling large datasets. This format supports advanced data compression and encoding schemes, which are optimized for complex data processing operations that are anticipated in later stages of this project.\n"

    "### 2. **Data Cleanup and Transformation**\n",
    "- **Description**: This phase focuses on standardizing, cleaning, and transforming raw data to prepare it for comprehensive analysis.\n",
    "- **Tools**: Utilized Pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical data operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In tackling the inconsistencies and disorganized nature of the raw dataset, I devised a strategic approach to streamline and standardize the data. I created a dictionary named `column_mappings` to align new, uniform column names with their various labels found in the dataset. This method ensured that data associated with similar content but differing labels, such as 'unitid' and 'UNITID', were consolidated under a single standardized column name.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this standardization, I iterated over each mapping in the dictionary. For each new column name defined, I verified the presence of its corresponding old columns in the raw DataFrame. If present, I migrated the data into a newly established, clean DataFrame. In situations where multiple old columns mapped to a single new column, I amalgamated the data from these columns, selecting the first non-null value for each entry. This approach effectively managed duplicates and missing values, resulting in a consolidated and more practical dataset. I then used `clean_data.head()` to preview the cleaned data, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the transformation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of this dataset, the `cipcode` column is particularly noteworthy as it encodes the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes, which are six-digit figures formatted as xx.xxxx. These codes classify instructional program specialties within educational institutions. Initially, I have retained these codes as numerical values to simplify the processing of this extensive dataset. This decision aids in performing operations like sorting, filtering, and grouping during the early stages of data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the initial numerical analysis, I plan to map these `cipcode` numbers to their respective educational program descriptions. This mapping will transform the numerical codes into meaningful descriptions, for example, converting '01.0101' into 'Agricultural Business and Management, General'. This crucial step will render the data more interpretable and relatable for stakeholders, thereby enhancing the utility and impact of the analytical reports.\n",

    "\n",
    "Efficient data management is crucial for both maintaining the integrity of raw data and ensuring the accessibility of processed information. In this project, data is handled as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Raw Data Storage**: Initially, the raw data is stored locally in CSV format, merged into a combined dataframe that is stored in a Parquet format. This approach allows for straightforward import and manipulation using tools like Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Processed Data Storage**: After cleaning and transforming the data, it is stored in Parquet format on the local filesystem. Parquet is a columnar storage file format that offers efficient data compression and encoding schemes. This format is optimized for performance in handling large datasets and provides excellent support for advanced data operations. By storing the processed data in Parquet files, we ensure that it is ready for efficient access and detailed analysis, significantly enhancing the performance of data retrieval and processing tasks."

    "### Descriptive Analysis and Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "The dataset under investigation provides a comprehensive view of academic demographics and program classification at various educational institutions. With data entries amounting to nearly 5.8 million records, this extensive dataset includes a range of attributes from demographic information to program details, mapped through standardized classification codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Statistical Insights\n",
    "- **Count:** Each column in the dataset houses data for about 5.8 million entries, indicating no missing values in key numerical and categorical fields.\n",
    "- **Mean and Median Values:**\n",
    "  - The mean and median `unitid` values, correspond to unique identifiers for educational institutions, suggest a relatively uniform spread across the dataset.\n",
    "  - `majornum`, indicating the major number, has both a mean and a median of approximately 1, suggesting most data pertains to primary majors.\n",
    "  - The `cipcode` average of around 38 with a median of 42 shows a mid-range skew in program classification, possibly leaning towards certain categories of academic programs.\n",
    "  - `awlevel`, representing the award level, with a mean close to 5 and a median also at 5, may indicate a common award level across the dataset (potentially bachelor's degrees).\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation:** High standard deviations in demographic counts like `nonresident_alien_men`, `black_non_hispanic_men`, and `white_non_hispanic_women` reflect significant variability in enrollment figures across different institutions or programs.\n",
    "- **Minimum and Maximum Values:**\n",
    "  - The minimal and maximal values across demographic categories like `nonresident_alien_men` and `white_non_hispanic_men` ranging from 0 to over 10,000 indicate extreme variations, which could be due to the size and diversity of institutions.\n",
    "- **Quartiles:**\n",
    "  - The 25th percentile often hits 0 in demographic categories, which might suggest that many institutions do not have enrolments in certain demographic segments.\n",
    "  - The 75th percentile in columns like `total_men` and `total_women` shows values of 7 and 10, respectively, implying that the majority of data clusters below these numbers, but there are significant outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implications for Further Analysis\n",
    "The substantial spread and variability in demographics related to non-resident aliens and specific ethnic groups could warrant a deeper dive to understand the factors influencing these distributions. The concentration of data around specific `cipcodes` and `awlevel` suggests commonality in program offerings and degree levels that dominate the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disparity between the 75th percentile and max values in many demographic fields indicates the presence of outliers, likely representing very large institutions or those with specific demographic focuses. This aspect highlights the need for outlier management and normalization in further statistical or predictive analysis to ensure robustness and representativeness."

    "### Detailed Analysis and Insights from Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Distribution of Major Numbers**\n",
    "![Distribution of Major Numbers](images/majornum_distribution.png)\n",
    "The histogram for `majornum` reveals a highly concentrated distribution primarily between 1.0 and 1.1, with a sparse presence up to 2.0. This indicates that the majority of the entries in the dataset concern primary majors (indicated by a `majornum` of 1), with a smaller proportion representing secondary majors (indicated by a `majornum` of 2). The near absence of values between these two points suggests that the data does not categorize majors with finer granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Distribution of CIP Codes**\n",
    "![Distribution of CIP Codes](images/cipcode_distribution.png)\n",
    "The distribution of CIP codes shows several peaks, indicating concentrations of particular fields of study. Notable spikes around codes like 10, 40, and 50 reflect popular academic fields. Lower frequencies between these peaks may represent specialized or less common fields of study. The bimodal peaks around 40 and 50 could correspond to broad categories such as 'Health Professions' and 'Business', respectively, highlighting their prevalence in educational institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Distribution of Award Levels**\n",
    "![Distribution of Award Levels](images/awlevel_distribution.png)\n",
    "The histogram for `awlevel` demonstrates significant activity at levels 3, 5, and above 10, suggesting a commonality of associate degrees, bachelor's degrees, and advanced degrees. The spikes at specific levels might correlate with standard educational pathways, with few entries at intermediate levels, indicating less common types of certifications or diplomas.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Boxplot for Award Levels**\n",
    "![Boxplot for Award Levels](images/awlevel_boxplot.png)\n",
    "The boxplot for award levels shows that the interquartile range is tightly concentrated around lower levels, with outliers scattered across higher values. This concentration at lower award levels (like associate and bachelor's degrees) likely reflects the commonality of these degrees as terminal educational achievements in many fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Correlation Matrix of Variables**\n",
    "![Correlation Matrix of Variables](images/correlation_matrix.png)\n",
    "The correlation matrix provides insight into how different demographic and institutional variables interact with each other. For instance:\n",
    "- Strong positive correlations between gender-specific columns (e.g., `hispanic_men` and `hispanic_women`) suggest similar enrollment patterns across genders within the same ethnic group.\n",
    "- `total_men` and `total_women` show high positive correlation, indicating that programs tend to have balanced gender enrollments.\n",
    "- The low correlation between `unitid` and most demographic variables suggests that demographic distributions are relatively consistent across different institutions.\n",
    "- The negative correlations seen sporadically throughout the matrix might indicate inverse relationships in enrollment trends between different demographic groups across certain programs or institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these visualizations and their analysis provide a richer understanding of the structure and dynamics within the data, enabling targeted inquiries and informed decision-making in subsequent analyses."
